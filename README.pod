=head2 The technical side

=head3 Tools

CodeWars uses Mojolicious. Mojolicious is web framework for Perl.
Also it uses MySQL for database. It's not necessary, we can use other
databases but CodeWars is using MySQL now.
It can use data from phpbb3 application but CodeWars will break
structure of phpbb3.

=head3 Structure

It's a regular Mojolicious application. Only 'lib' and 'templates'
folders are interesting.
'templates' consists view-files. They are not written almost.

    lib
    `- CodeWars.pm             # Init, routes     [DB & signed cookies]
       |- DB.pm                # DataBase init & handler
       |- Utils.pm             # Some useful functions           [salt]
